## Docker
#### 1. Image VS Container
* Image: The file system and configuration(read-only) application which is used to create containers
* Container: These are running instances of Docker images. Containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS.


**A great Analogy**: The `image` is the recipe, the `container` is the cake. you can make as many cakes as you like with a given recipe.

## Web

#### 1. Cookie VS Cache
* Cookie: used to store information to track different characteristics related to user
* Cache: just a collection of data downloaded to help display a web page. And is for making the loading of websites faster.

* Typically, cookies expire after some time, but cache is kept in the clientâ€™s machine until they are removed manually by the user.
