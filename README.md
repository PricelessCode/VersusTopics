## Docker
1. Image VS Container
* Image: The file system and configuration(read-only) application which is used to create containers
* Container: These are running instances of Docker images. Containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS.


**A great Analogy**: The `image` is the recipe, the `container` is the cake. you can make as many cakes as you like with a given recipe.
